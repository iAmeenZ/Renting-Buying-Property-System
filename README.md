# Renting Buying Property System

Renting and Buying Property System project for Information System Development assignment. Completed on 7 Jan 2020.

A group project that must be developed to get marks in the subject of Information System Development. This project uses a data backend by using a relational database (phpMyAdmin). SQL database can reference sql.txt.

Although this project needs to be developed in groups, it is 90% developed by myself. I am interested in creating a system that is more complex and equivalent to other systems that are already in the release production stage.
